Raspberry Pi 3 compatible assembly program.


This project contains my own programming excercises on ARM assembly.
The initial work started with learning very of basics of 
assembly language, starting on January 2021.

The program is still under construction.
TODO:
1. GPIO mode parameters' reading from file instead of stdin.
2. Raspberry Pi 3 GPIO mode settings' verifying.

X. Program that reads events from certain GPIO inputs
   and calculates their amount per time frame.

I'll may do the Part X with C (considering also asm).
