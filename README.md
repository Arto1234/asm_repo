Raspberry Pi 3 compatible assembly program.


This project contains my own programming excercises on ARM assembly.
The initial work started with learning the very basics of 
assembly language, starting on January 2021.

The program is still under construction.
Purpose 1: To learn basics of ARM assembly.
Purpose 2: To create a way to make GPIO modeset configurations for Raspberry Pi, according to a fixed configuration set.

TODO:
1. GPIO mode parameters' reading in a parametrised way. Now functions basically from stdin.
2. Raspberry Pi 3 GPIO mode settings' verifying.
X. Program that reads events from certain GPIO inputs and calculates their amount per time frame.

I'll may do the Part X with C (considering also asm).
